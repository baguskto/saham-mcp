### 7. User Stories

```gherkin
Feature: Quick Stock Check
  As a retail investor
  I want to check stock prices in my AI assistant
  So that I don't need to switch applications

  Scenario: Check single stock price
    Given I'm using Claude/Cursor
    When I ask "What's BBCA price?"
    Then I should see current price, change, and volume
    And response should be under 2 seconds

Feature: Market Analysis
  As a financial analyst
  I want to analyze sector performance
  So that I can make informed recommendations

  Scenario: Compare sector performance
    Given I'm analyzing the market
    When I ask "Show banking vs consumer sector this month"
    Then I should see comparative performance data
    And include top stocks from each sector
```
